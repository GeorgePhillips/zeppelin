NetHui 2017 will be held on 9-10 November at [Auckland's Aotea Centre.](https://www.aucklandlive.co.nz/venue/aotea-centre)

For seven years InternetNZ has helped bring NetHui to New Zealanders interested in the future of the Internet – it’s been held in cities, regions and at your house via live streaming. This year, as promised, NetHui's classic national event is back!

We have closed the first NetHui consultation where we asked what you want out of NetHui 2017. We’re looking over your suggestions to help us create the theme and search for a great keynote. A further consultation will be out in another few months where you’ll be able to tell us about specific sessions you want to hear or be part of.

<br>So keep an eye out and share your thoughts to help shape NetHui 2017.
